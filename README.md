# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to exploring the process of Requirement Analysis in software development. It provides detailed explanations, examples, and visual aids to help learners and practitioners understand how to define, document, and validate software requirements effectively. 

The content covers key topics such as the concept and importance of Requirement Analysis, key activities, types of requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria. Additionally, practical examples for a booking management system are included to illustrate these concepts in action.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software to be developed. Its main goal is to ensure that all stakeholders—including users, clients, and developers—have a clear and shared understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

The importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC includes:
- **Clarity and Understanding:** Reduces misunderstandings among stakeholders.  
- **Scope Definition:** Clearly defines project boundaries to prevent scope creep.  
- **Basis for Design and Development:** Provides a solid foundation for building the system.  
- **Cost and Time Estimation:** Helps accurately estimate resources, time, and costs.  
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensures the final product meets specified requirements and stakeholder expectations.
